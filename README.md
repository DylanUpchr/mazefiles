# mazefiles
A set of classic micromouse maze files in text format

These files may, or may not, represent actual contest mazes. If there are errors in contest mazes, please let me know. Preferably with a photo of the original maze so that I can make changes.

These files are a companion to the maze tool https://github.com/micromouseonline/micromouse_maze_tool
