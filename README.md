# mazefiles
A set of micromouse maze files in text format. They have been collected over some years from many sources.

These files are a companion to the maze tool https://github.com/micromouseonline/micromouse_maze_tool.

The format used here has three characters per horizontal wall to make them easier to read when displayed on the screen or printed out. 

**classic** mazes are all 16x16. Some of these have smaller active areaswhere the event in which they were used only had a smaller maze available. That may have been 7x8, 8x8, 11x11 or some other size. All these mazes have a legal goal cell in cell 7,7.

**halfsize** mazes are all 32x32. The goal is not fixed in the same way as it might be in the classic contest. Goal cells are marked with an asterisk in the centre of the cell. The goal may be a single cell or a rectangular block of cells.

**training** mazes are all 16x16 but may not have legal goal areas as the useable area might be only 5x5, 8x8, 10x5 or some other size representing small mazes used for testing a mouse where there is not room for a full sized maze. The filename should indicate the active area.

The files may, or may not, represent actual contest mazes. If there are errors in contest mazes, please let me know. Preferably with a photo of the original maze so that I can make changes.
